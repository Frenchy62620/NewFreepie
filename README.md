FreePIE
=======

Programmable Input Emulator
 
Original project could be found https://github.com/AndersMalmgren/FreePIE

I will edit this file or wiki to explain the different functions of NewFreepie

See https://github.com/Frenchy62620/NewFreepie/wiki

In source code i have put the associated compilated version of FreePie (portable version), and the last version of Vjoy (virtual joystick)

I have done lot of modifications for Keyboard, joystick, Vjoy and so on, but not for Wiimote or others like Oculus, Hydra ....

Just for reading and apply the functionality if you like
