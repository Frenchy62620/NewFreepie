=======

Programmable Input Emulator
 
Original project could be found https://github.com/AndersMalmgren/FreePIE

I will edit this file or wiki to explain the different functions of NewFreepie

See https://github.com/Frenchy62620/NewFreepie/wiki/Index

In source code i have put the associated compliated version of FreePie (portable version), and the last version of Vjoy (virtual joystick)
